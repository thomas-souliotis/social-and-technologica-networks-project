In order to run the python code the following should be followed!
• Install Python3 and the packages, numpy, networkx, sklearn,
matplotlib
• You should download the suggested datasets provided by the
project description. Extract the file containing the datasets in
the same folder with the stnCode.py
• Run: python3 stnCode.py
• In order to avoid too many computations I have commented
out some piece of code worth running. This kind of comments
are the ones between the comments of the type:

• In the code more results than those shown at the report are
produced. The main reason of not reporting these results is
purely to keep the report short.
• Most clustering algorithms were found online(or in packages),
but were properly transformed so as to offer the wanted results.
• The datasets are not that huge and the whole computations
can be efficientely done by a home-computer. However, ran-
domly sampling the input data is also an option, which is not
advised(supplementary code can be provided, the only action
needed is actually to import random and select a random vari-
able depending the random selection protocol wanted).
• The code is properly documented and commented however feel
free to e-mail me at thomas7777@hotmail.gr for any questions.
